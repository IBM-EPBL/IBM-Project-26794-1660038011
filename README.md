## ‚≠êABSTRACT

Handwritten Digit Recognition is the ability of computer systems to recognise handwritten digits from various sources, such as images, documents, and so on. Handwritten digit recognition has a wide range of applications, including number plate identification, bank check processing, address interpretation from envelopes, and so on.
The fundamental problem with handwritten digit recognition is that handwritten digits do not always have the same size, width, orientation, and margins since they vary from person to person. Additionally, there would be issues with identifying the numbers because of similarities between numerals like 1 and 7, 5 and 6, 3 and 8, 2 and 5, 2 and 7, etc. Finally, the individuality and variation of each individual's handwriting influence the structure and appearance of the digits.
Therefore, this project aims to address these problems and provide a novel handwritten digit recognition system.
